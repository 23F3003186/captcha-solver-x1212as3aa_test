    <h1>Hello (fallback)</h1>
    <p>This app was generated as a fallback because OpenAI failed. Brief: add a red button to the page that, when clicked, fetches the captcha image from the provided URL, displays it to the user, and allows them to input the solved text. Upon submission, the page should display the solved text.</p>
